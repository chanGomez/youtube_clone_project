## Project Overview

We created a YouTube application using the React framework in
JavaScript. The application is fully functional and allows users to
search for videos. The search results are displayed on a video page,
where users can view snippets of the search input. When a user clicks
on a video, a new page is rendered with the selected video. On this
page, there is also a comment section where users can type their name
and leave a comment on the page. Once submitted, the comments are
rendered on the page.
